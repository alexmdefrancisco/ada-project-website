Active in scouting since childhood as a Boy Scout and Rover, with a strong appreciation for nature and outdoor activities. Currently engaged in the financial sector, a career outcome he is still in the process of rationally justifying."

  description: "Graduated as Aerospace Engineer, Alex transitioned into Financial Engineering at EPFL to apply rigorous mathematical modeling to capital markets. His background combines the execution-driven mindset of a tech co-founder—having scaled a platform to over 100,000 users—with deep technical expertise in Stochastic Calculus and Machine Learning. He is dedicated to bridging the gap between advanced engineering simulations and alpha generation in quantitative finance."

- name: "Tommaso Mencattini"

  profession: "Data Scientist"

  description: "Tommaso is a Master’s student in Data Science at EPFL and works at GLADIA on large language models, with a focus on model merging and on making such systems more interpretable and safer. His academic background is notably interdisciplinary: he holds a Bachelor’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics from Amsterdam and a degree in Philosophy from Rome, which means he knows more mathematics than most philosophers, more computer science than most mathematicians, and more philosophy than most computer scientists—an outcome that is occasionally confusing but generally useful. Outside academia and research, his interests include music, film, and philosophy, the latter now revisited less frequently than intended, largely due to an excess of datasets and deadlines."
